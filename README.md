# wind-js-leaflet

Simple demo of [ESRI's WindJS](https://github.com/Esri/wind-js) used with a Leaflet map.

For this demo we use the [L.CanvasOverlay.js]() plugin for Leaflet to overlay canvas for drawing.
Plus I pinched the nicer colour styling from [this demo](http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/fc62d1de6ada1e06b803).
